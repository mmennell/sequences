<h1>A Quick Puzzle to Test Your Problem Solving</h1>

<p>A short game sheds light on government policy, corporate America and why no one likes to be wrong.</p>

<p>Here’s how it works:</p>

<p>We’ve chosen a rule that some sequences of three numbers obey — and some do not. Your job is to guess what the rule is.</p>

<p>We’ll start by telling you that the sequence 2, 4, 8 obeys the rule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    2, 4, 8 Obeys the rule
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now it’s your turn. Enter a number sequence in the boxes below, and we’ll tell you whether it satisfies the rule or not. You can test as many sequences as you want.</p>

<ul>
      <% @list.each do |guess| %>
      <li>
        <%= guess.firstnum %>,
        <%= guess.secondnum %>,
        <%= guess.thirdnum %>
      <% if guess.firstnum < guess.secondnum && guess.secondnum <  guess.thirdnum %>
      Yes!
      <% else %>
      No.
      <% end %>
      </li>
      <% end %>
      <!-- <%= @firstnum %>,
      <%= @secondnum %>,
      <%= @thirdnum %>

      <%=  @result %> -->
</ul>

<form action="/all_guesses">
  <p>
    Enter a sequence:
  </p>

<label for="first">First number:</label>
<input type ="text" placeholder="The first number" id = "first" name ="f">

<label for="second">Second number:</label>
<input type ="text" placeholder="The second number" id = "second" name ="s">

<label for="third">Third number:</label>
<input type ="text" placeholder="The third number" id = "third" name = "t">

  When you think you know the rule, describe it in words below and then submit your answer. <strong>Make sure you’re right; you won’t get a second chance.</strong>
